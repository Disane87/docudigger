        ## Record the way you download your documents
        To add a scraper for a specific webpage, we need some information about the page.

        The chance is pretty high, we don't use your service website. So you have to provide us a way to code this entire process. Luckily Chrome have a recorder fur Puppeteer (the library we use to scrape the page). Please study the following link ([Puppeteer Recorder with Chrome DevTools (testingbot.com)](https://testingbot.com/support/puppeteer/recorder.html#)) and create a `.js`with the recording.

      description: Ensure you only click the parts that are needed to get a download of the desired document. Its important that you provide us a recording with `@puppeteer/replay`

      required: true
